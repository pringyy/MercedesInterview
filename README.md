# Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team Technical Interview Solution

This is my solution for the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 team technical interview which was implemented using Python. This README provides a breif outline of the flie structure and any assumptions I have made from the task sheet provided. **A [user manual](manual.md) is also provided which describes how to run the system and unit tests.**


## File Structure
* [presentation/](presentation) - contains presentation files demonstraiting the project
* **[src/](src) - contains all the code for the project**
* [src/main.py](main.py) - the program which implements the task
* [src/test.py](test.py) - test cases which test the function within main.py
* [src/inputs](src/inputs) - contains all the input file which are read into main.py
* [src/outputs](src/outputs) - stores the output of the main.py program
